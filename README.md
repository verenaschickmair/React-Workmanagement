# Project "Workmanagement Web-App in React"

The goal is to build a ticket system like Asana or Jira, but in a simplified way. It should be possible to create projects. Members can then be assigned to a project and managed. Tasks can then be added to a project. A task can consist of title, description, responsible members and the date of creation. The tasks are displayed in a board, and by default they will be added in the backlog. Then the tasks can be moved from the backlog to the desired column. There should be a predefined board with predefined columns e.g. Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Review, Done. This project should be done with only states and global states (with recoil) and no backend api-calls are used.
